1. State of the Art Parser

Both the Stanford and Berkeley parsers seemed to be fooled by the sentence,

"Why did you bring that table that the book was on up?"

which contains center embedding and ends in two prepositions. They both parsed
the sentence in the following way.

(ROOT
  (SBARQ
    (WHADVP (WRB Why))
    (SQ (VBD did)
      (NP (PRP you))
      (VP (VB bring)
        (NP
          (NP (DT that) (NN table))
          (SBAR (IN that)
            (S
              (NP (DT the) (NN book))
              (VP (VBD was)
                (ADVP (RB on) (RB up))))))))
    (. ?)))

Clearly, however, "on up" is not an adverb phrase in this context, but rather
on was a preposition refering to the table.

Interestingly, the sentence,

"Is he okay, the person that fell?"

was parsed incorrectly by the Stanford parser, but parsed correctly by the
Berkeley parser. The Stanford parser produced,

(ROOT
  (SQ (VBZ Is)
    (NP (PRP he))
    (NP
      (NP
        (NP (NNP okay))
        (, ,)
        (NP (DT the) (NN person)))
      (SBAR
        (WHNP (WDT that))
        (S
          (VP (VBD fell)))))
    (. ?)))

which is incorrect in that "okay, person that fell" is not a noun phrase. The
Berkeley parser produced,

(ROOT
  (SQ (VBZ Is)
    (NP (PRP he))
    (ADJP (JJ okay))
    (, ,)
    (NP
      (NP (DT the) (NN person))
      (SBAR
        (WHNP (WDT that))
        (S
          (VP (VBD fell)))))
    (. ?)))

which seems to us to be the correct parse. Similarly, the Stanford parser
parsed the reverse sentence, 

"The person that fell, is he okay?"

incorrectly as well, while the Berkeley parser parsed correctly. Stanford's output was 

(ROOT
  (SQ
    (S
      (NP
        (NP (DT The) (NN person))
        (NP (DT that)))
      (VP (VBD fell)))
    (, ,)
    (SQ (VBZ is)
      (NP (PRP he))
      (ADJP (JJ okay)))
    (. ?)))

which is incorrect because "The person that" is not a noun phrase. Berkeley,
however, correctly identified the that clause with the following parse.

(ROOT
  (S
    (NP
      (NP (DT The) (NN person))
      (SBAR
        (WHNP (WDT that))
        (S
          (VP (VBD fell)))))
    (, ,)
    (SQ (VBZ is)
      (NP (PRP he))
      (ADJP (JJ okay))
      (. ?))))

Again quite interestingly, the sentence 

"A photo tour of one of the largest arcades in the world!"

grabbed from a Reddit post title is correctly identified as a fragment by the
Berkeley parser.

(ROOT
  (FRAG
    (NP
      (NP (DT A) (JJ photo) (NN tour))
      (PP (IN of)
        (NP
          (NP (CD one))
          (PP (IN of)
            (NP
              (NP (DT the) (JJS largest) (NNS arcades))
              (PP (IN in)
                (NP (DT the) (NN world))))))))
    (. !)))

I've never thought about how something looks like.

I've never thought about how something looks. 

Also words like "gimme" don't seem to fool the parser.
